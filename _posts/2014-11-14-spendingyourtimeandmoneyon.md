Just watching the [YC-Startup course](https://startupclass.co/courses/how-to-start-a-startup/), and really get some inspiration, not only work but life.

The lecture talk about how to choose co-founder or employees:

> 1. Are they smart?
> 2. Do they get things done?
> 3. Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?

Also I was inspired that the question “What are you spending your time and money on?”.

The answer for this question is actually good reference for you to get know the person you asked.

Each person is an individual body. They are all different to each other. But how we gather the same kind of people together? How you identify that this kind of people is the same with you. I think now you can have a conclusion.

What you do just make who you are! And you are unique because you spend your time and money on things others don’t. Think about that and keep doing what you think valuable. And so it’s you.
