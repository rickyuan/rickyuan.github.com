<h2>Personal Skills</h2>

<p>I have been worked as a product designer for 3 years since 2009. As I was a product editor before 2009, when I design a product, I also think about operation and marketing. Most products I do are web apps, websites or mobile apps.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Before high school, I was really a good boy to teachers. I was short, cute, and good at studies. Never make trouble in school.</p>

<p>My high school is the best one of our city. I like sports, really. Someone like play and do not study, someone like study and do not play. But to me, the two beautiful places are playground and library. I can&rsquo;t remember how many times I go to play basketball or read books in library instead of eat dinner. There is also a remarkable thing I want to talk. For a long time I can&rsquo;t pass the english exam, I even do not to know how to learn it. But after a new teacher introduced a new way to learn english, and I start to do what he ask us to do. Half a year later, I got the NO.1 of school english exam for once. It give me lots of confidence when I learn other things. That&rsquo;s also why I choose english as my second major in college.</p>

<p>I study college in Huzhong science and technology university in Wuhan, Hubei province, far away from home. From the second year, I own my first computer. Since then, expect class and football, I got a new fun. I sat in front of my desk all day and night, explore all kinds of new things through internet. I learn photoshop and dreamwaver, flash and website design. I build my first blog through 163 service, it&rsquo;s really simple and just some static htmls. Then I build a class forum for our classmates. So girls and boys can talk to each other with this platform and write the interesting things they think. Though my major are chinese and english, but I can do better with computer than others. I find I love this internet stuff, and like to learn them. That&rsquo;s why I decide to work in an internet company than the other choice.</p>
